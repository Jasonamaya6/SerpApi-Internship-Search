## Overview
The Internship Search and Store project is a Python application designed to search for internship opportunities using the SerpApi Google Search API and store the results in a MySQL database. This project aims to automate the process of searching for internships and maintaining a record of the search results for future reference.

## Features

Python 3.x
MySQL server
SerpApi Python client (serpapi)

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set up a MySQL database and create a table named search_results using the provided SQL script (setup.sql).
Obtain an API key from SerpApi and replace the placeholder in the Python script (search_and_store_internships.py) with your API key.


## Current Development 

Still attempting to expand on this to make it betetr and evetually have some virtualizzation for a more comprehensive approach
